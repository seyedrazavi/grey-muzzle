    <title><anchor id="_Toc62466572"/>Overview</title>
    <para>This is an ambitious 4X* game allowing players to leave their mark and be part of a story literally decades in the telling.</para>
    <para>The game has been continuously running since 1992 with the setting evolving alongside the rise and fall of factions, the ebb and flow of narrative arcs, but ultimately player diplomacy. Players entering this open-ended game join existing factions, or even create their own, and aspire to find their place in a vast galaxy.</para>
    <para>The setting is asymmetric, with some factions vastly superior to others.  Although all factions face their own challenges, this variety allows players to choose a power level and game style to suit their own preferences. The ability to control many assets gives every player the capacity and opportunity to take part in all aspects of the game if they choose to do so.</para>
    <para>This is not a game to pick up lightly or quickly. Whereas all games have a learning curve, Phoenix has been described as having a learning cliff and a game written by engineers for engineers (actually, it was a game written by physicists). It has, however, been designed to have balanced and compelling mechanics even if this means not shying away from complexity where necessary. The draw of the game can therefore easily be missed by the casual gamer. To use the learning cliff analogy again, it is fair to say the view from the top of the cliff bears little resemblance to the one from the bottom.</para>
    <para>While there is no consensus on what appeals most about the game, terms such as big picture, longevity, depth, variety, plotlines, and camaraderie often feature in descriptions. </para>

    <title><anchor id="_Toc62466573"/>Introduction</title>
    <para>Phoenix: Beyond the Stellar Empire, or simply Phoenix, is a game set 200 years in the future when humanity’s expanding Stellar Empire collided with alien species and various human factions that previously fled the draconian laws of the emperor.</para>
    <para>Distant 'Peripheries' have been discovered. These are huge areas of space consisting of many star systems, accessible only by starships. The race is on to explore, exploit, colonise or even conquer them by several of the larger power factions. Some factions are there to make money, some to rule. Players can join one of these groups, called Affiliations, and seek to make a name for themselves on the bold new frontier.</para>
    <para/>
    <para>From signing up and completing the first mission, it will be discovered just how much there is to do in this vast game. This, and the size of the rulebook, may even be a little daunting. Do not worry, learning the game is possible as new aspects are encountered. The rulebook is mostly for reference.</para>
    <para/>
    <para>For the first days, players only need to follow the missions, submitting orders as turn reports are returned after processing. It is useful to contract the affiliations which appeal most to help decide which to join. Details on their recruitment profiles can be found on Nexus. They are located at the bottom of the Forum page under News/Blogs/Recruitment.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title><anchor id="_Toc51331323"/><anchor id="_Toc62466574"/>Position Types</title>
      <para>There are several different types of playable positions in Phoenix: Starships, Bases, Ground Parties, Platforms, Agents and Political Positions. Players start in command of a Starship. Starships are all-purpose spacecraft capable of exploration, cargo haulage, and combat. Bases are installations founded on worlds throughout the Periphery. Ground Parties are composed of people and equipment (usually) and are commonly used to explore or conduct military operations on the surface of a world. Platforms are battle stations often built in orbit to protect a world. Political Positions are the assets’ leaders (and possibly even a player’s alter-ego) and represent the person who actually runs the Affiliations. Agents are normally used to infiltrate other players’ bases.</para>
      <para>Some of these positions have subtypes which are dealt with in their own appropriate section.</para>

    <title><anchor id="_Toc51331324"/><anchor id="_Toc62466575"/>How to Play</title>
    <para>Orders for individual positions are created as needed or desired on Nexus. Once the batch is completed, they are submitted for the next day’s processing, often referred to as the Day’s Run. All orders are processed, and the results called turn reports are uploaded to Nexus. Using this information, the next set of orders is created. While starships are free to play, certain orders (requiring Game Moderator response), a few update requests and weekly report generation have a fee. The turn fee costs are detailed in the Rules section of the Library on Nexus. </para>
    <para/>
    <para>Players acquire more than one position but there is no need to play all of them, all the time. A ship or ground party can stay in the same location for weeks without any orders being processed for them, ready to resume action when commanded.</para>
    <para/>
    <para>Turn Reports</para>
    <para>Where necessary to aid explanation, example sections from turn reports are used and will look like this:</para>

      <para>While there is not strict path to follow, this is the typical route a player will take:</para>
      <para>Sign-up and first ship</para>
      <para>Complete first mission</para>
      <para>Create second ship and new mission</para>
      <para>Create political – which comes with more ships</para>
      <para>Join an affiliation</para>
      <para>Leave Halo (training grounds)</para>
      <para>Take on a few affiliation ships and jobs</para>
      <para>Trade and explore on behalf of the affiliation</para>
      <para>Establish some outposts</para>
      <para>Take on or establish a starbase</para>
      <para>Take on warships</para>
      <para>Become involved in colonisation</para>
      <para>Get involved in politics</para>
      <para>The nature of the game is that some players will become more involved in some areas than others. Some may end up concentrating on colonisation while others fixate on war or politics.</para>

      <title><anchor id="_Toc51331326"/><anchor id="_Toc62466577"/>Game Basics</title>
      <para>The following units of measurement are used in Phoenix:</para>
      <para/>
      <para>Money:        Measured in Stellars. All Stellar transfers are in whole numbers.</para>
      <para>Time:        A game week consists of 5 daily runs (normally Monday to Friday) in which orders are processed for positions and the turn results are uploaded to Nexus. Every action performed has a time cost measured in Time Units (TUs). Positions can have a maximum of 300 TUs. These may all be used in a single set of orders processed in a single run. They accumulate at a rate of 60 TUs per day.</para>
      <para>Mass:        Mass is measured in Mass Units (MUs). Every Item in the game has a weight in MUs. This may represent physical weight of the object but also includes subjective elements such as volume or ancillary equipment such as living space or storage container. </para>
      <para>Items:        Any game object that has been given a specific number is an Item representing all instances of the ubiquitous object, e.g. Human Colonist (773). Items can be anything from raw materials, manufactured goods, technology and people.</para>
      <para/>
      <para>Every Ship, Platform and Ground Party may perform up to 300 Time Units (TUs) worth of actions in a single run. While they can be issued with many orders and therefore TUs worth of activity, orders will stop being processed when the position runs out of TUs. When this happens, the remaining orders are held over as Pending. They will be uploaded to Nexus where they can be viewed and will automatically be processed when the position has accumulated 300TUs or when an update report is requests. They can also be modified but then must be re-submitted.</para>
      <para>Stop on Error is an option when issuing orders to prevent the position continuing to process further orders.</para>
      <para>Example: Stop on Error is selected when picking up a Stargate Key as there is no point continuing on to the Stargate if the ship failed to pick up and install the key.</para>
      <para/>
      <para/>
      <para>Wait for TUs/Day/Stardate order can be issued to hold processing of pending orders until the criteria is satisfied.</para>

        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331327"/><anchor id="_Toc62466578"/>The Game Week</title>
        <para>The Phoenix game week runs from Monday to Friday, weekly. All orders are processed, in random order after they have been downloaded from Nexus on a given day. It is possible to sequence positions allowing for orders on one position to be processed before those on another. This is often used to deliver Items to a ship before it moves away from its current location or to deliver modules to a base before it attempts to build complexes.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331328"/><anchor id="_Toc62466579"/>Position Maintenance Adjustments</title>
        <para>Each position has a maintenance day where it performs its weekly adjustments such as paying wages. Ships and Ground Parties are not greatly affected by these so long as they are being run competently but adjustments for bases are much more numerous as this is when things like collecting revenues and resources, research, mining and factory production are calculated. Bases can change their maintenance day to fit in with other positions. This is useful ensuring minerals from secondary bases are delivered to the main base for manufacturing.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331329"/><anchor id="_Toc62466580"/>Weekly Adjustments</title>
        <para>Following Monday’s Run, there are a sequence of adjustments for the entire game. These include sales to planetary populations, star system income to claiming affiliations and potential decay of planetary infrastructure (amongst other things). Details can be found in the appropriate section.</para>

        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331330"/><anchor id="_Toc62466581"/>Moderated Actions</title>
        <para>Certain orders cannot be processed by the game engine and require the Phoenix GM (Game Moderator/GM) to deal with them. They allow players to attempt any non-standard (i.e. non-programmed) actions. As they require human moderation, they have a fee associated with them.</para>
        <para>Moderation is designed to augment the game mechanics, not circumvent them. Attempts to change the rules of the game are almost certain to fail, such as ‘open fire on allies’ and ‘make my ship go faster by...’.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>Surface Exploration and Investigations are two specific types of Special Action generally used when exploring a planet. They are explained fully in Exploration. </para>
        <para/>
        <para>Moderated actions are processed after standard orders for all positions have been completed and the turn reports uploaded (and emails sent) to avoid delays. Special actions for bases will be deferred until after weekly maintenance if submitted on the same day.</para>

        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331331"/><anchor id="_Toc62466582"/>Squadron Orders</title>
        <para>It is possible to assign ships to a squadron. This allows orders given to a single ship to be applied to each ship in the squadron. This is useful for avoiding repeating orders to many positions. There is also the option of copying sets of orders to other positions. The pros and cons are covered in Starships.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331332"/><anchor id="_Toc62466583"/>Submitting Orders</title>
        <para>Orders are normally completed for the positions to be processed on the next day’s Run or through the use of Wait for TUs/Day/Stardate, at a specific day in the future. There are also standing orders that though processed on the next Run may not be implemented until required. In all cases, turns will only be downloaded and processed through the Submit button on the Orders page.</para>
        <para>Between submitting orders and their download there is the opportunity to view and review queued orders for positions.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331333"/><anchor id="_Toc62466584"/>Daily Run</title>
        <para>The progression of processes through the daily run accounts for why certain events may proceed orders.</para>
        <para>Example: Deliveries of ore to a starbase on its maintenance day will fail to arrive prior to the starbase undertaking production. The confusion occurs as the starbase manifest (appended after processing) indicates that it has the required minerals.</para>

    <para>When signing up to play, players create a Phoenix Account. All their positions will be associated with this Phoenix Account. A Phoenix Account may have a single Political position. The position represents a person with power and a measure of autonomy within the Phoenix universe and represent the face of a group of wealthy/influential backers. </para>
    <para>Creating a political is required to control anything beyond ships. The basic level is free to play.</para>
    <para>Once created the stellars (wealth) of all the positions are linked to a central stellar account. Each week, all positions draw wages from the central political fund. This is automatic and cannot be avoided.</para>
    <para>Issues and Voting </para>
    <para>The rank within an affiliation determines how many votes the political has. These are used to determine outcomes of issues raised by affiliation members. Most affiliations have the following political structure.</para>

Until aware of when they are added, it is sensible to refrain from requesting updates until the day before the political’s weekly maintains.</para>
      <para>Starbase Troop Subsidy - As the title implies this subsidy is paid towards troop wages at starbases only. The amount is set during the political's maintenance. Maintaining starbases will draw from this fund until it has all gone or it is reset on the political’s next maintenance.</para>
      <para>Starbase Creation Package - One-off package per Phoenix Account. Using the 'Claim Budget Starbase' starbase order will add items to the starbase. The claiming starbase must be on a populated world and cannot have claimed before, i.e. under a previous owner. Claiming, prevents the starbase from converting to outpost for 5 weeks.</para>

      <para>Unrestricted data is universally known and can be used by anyone in the game. Generic items, public star systems and celestial bodies fall into these categories. This is effectively starting knowledge.</para>
      <para>Restricted information is discovered through playing the game. It may be found through research, exploration and investigations or by treaties and direct transfer of the data from other players.</para>

      </para>
      <para>There are two levels to restricted system knowledge:</para>
      <para>Location Knowledge</para>
      <para>This is the most basic level and allows the player to look at the system on Nexus. When a player only has this level of knowledge, the system will not be positioned in its correct location on Nexus Jump Map. The system icon may even show link spurs indicating that the player knows how to jump out of the system to adjacent systems. There will not be jump links directed towards this system. </para>
      <para>This level of knowledge is normally granted at the time a player has a position within the system (generally the result of a transfer). The knowledge may also be transferred directly.</para>
      <para>This system however cannot be reached by jumping as the player does not have navigation knowledge.</para>
      <para>Navigation Knowledge</para>
      <para>This is originally granted through completion of a relevant stellar cartography project. Once granted, the system will appear in the correct location on the Nexus Jump Map along with links connecting to the appropriate destination.</para>
      <para>Simply having positions in the system DOES NOT grant Navigational Knowledge, thus preventing the knowledge being transferred to third parties either by accident or design simply by transferring positions to another player.</para>
      <para>Affiliation Treaties for system data will grant ACCESS to navigational data. If they remove the treaty the ACCESS is lost. Owners of ships in the system will still gain location data but the ability to jump into the system will cease.</para>
      <para>Treaties do not chain – if the FLZ grant Access to Navigation Knowledge to the HEX, the HEX cannot create a treaty with the GTT to grant Access Navigation. At best they will only grant Location Knowledge.</para>

      <para>Multiple Officers</para>
      <para>When multiple officers are on board a ship, the probability of an individual officer gaining a Pt due to the activities of the ship has the formula:</para>
      <para>

      Probability of Officer gaining Pt= {Base Probability of Officer gaining Pt} over {sqrt {Number of officers}}
     
    </para>
      <para>Example: If there is a 10% base chance of a Pt being awarded to an officer and there are 4 officers, each officer has a 5% chance of gaining a Pt (=10/√4)</para>
      <para/>
      <para/>
      <para>In combat, total awarded Pts are shared out amongst the officers using the following formula:</para>

    <para>Ship specifications reflect the job they have been designed for. The typical roles they perform range from transport of goods for trading or colonisation, to exploration of new worlds, to combat. A merchant ship will have a large cargo capacity while an exploration vessel will have sensors and exploration modules. Warships will be packed with weapons and armour.</para>
    <para/>
    <para>Travelling through space, trading, exploring and virtually all other actions require time to complete. While certain actions take a set amount of time, such as picking up and delivering items, the time requirement for other actions is based on the design of the ship and the type of action performed. Having more thrust engines will increase take-off speed for example.</para>
    <para/>
    <para>Ships are defined by their design and class. Design is defined by quantity and type of hull along with armour while class is defined by their specialised role. A ship that has not been specialised has the Generic class.</para>

Further, even if counter attacked such as by escorts, it would ignore incoming attacks and continue to fire missiles against its preferred targets.

        <para>All actions have a chance of reducing the integrity of a ship. The chance can range from 0% through to 100%, i.e. some will never reduce the integrity of a ship under normal circumstances. Each action also has a maximum integrity loss. Should the action trigger an integrity loss, the integrity of the ship will drop by a random amount up to the maximum integrity loss. Before this loss is applied to the ship however, it is first multiplied by the ship’s integrity modifier. For example, a ship landing on a planet may incur a maximum integrity loss of 2%. For a ship constructed out of heavy hulls, the maximum loss will be 1% but for a ship constructed out of XLight hulls this could be as much as 8%.</para>

        <para>Due to integrity losses only ships with current integrity greater than 20% will be allowed to have items installed in them. If current integrity falls below 20% any further attempts to install items will fail.</para>

        <para>Often a ship has been reconfigured from the original blueprint design. This is especially true where new weapon configurations have been tested and proved to be more effective than the ones listed on the original blueprint. As such refitting to the original blueprint would end up removing a lot of useful items. As such it is possible to design templates using the position editor based on the desired configuration of installed items.</para>
        <para>Ships performing the Refit to Template order must be docked with a base with 1 active shipyard per 10 ship hulls. They also need to own the base or have the security code to be allowed to do a refit.</para>
        <para>The base will try to convert the fitting to a template that has been designed on the phoenix nexus position editor. There is no integrity loss for the installation, but patches are used to add the items safely. If 'Use low Tech' is not checked the best items available at the base will be used.</para>
        <para>All uninstalled items will be returned to the base that the ship is docked at.</para>

        <para>Example: Cargo Pods are constructed from 175 Light Hulls. As such their weekly maintenance cost per pod is:</para>

        <para>Integrity loss on pods is integrated into the overall integrity of a ship for the purposes of the manifest report, i.e. a 50 Light hull ship with 2 pods will have a weekly patch cost of 400 Light Hulls (=2x175+50).</para>
        <para>Where Light Pods are coupled with XLight hulls, the overall integrity will drop appropriately to the relative quantities of XLight hulls to Light hulls.</para>
        <para>Example: A single Light Pod (175 hulls) coupled to a 175 XLight hull ship will have a weekly decay rate of 3%(=175x2+175x4 /350). Weekly patch cost = 1.05 patches (=3x350x0.1/100).</para>

        <para>Sensors work in Passive and Active modes. Passive scanning is the most common, listing positions and during order processing and positions detected by the ship while inactive (between turn report). Worlds and other celestial objects are also reported and if previously unknown will automatically be added to the player’s data archive.</para>
        <para>Active scanning is achieved through orders such as scan location and detailed scan. In the case of Scan Location, the quantity of TUs is submitted. This number will then be modified by the efficiency of the ship as it is bound by the same mechanics as moving through space. </para>
        <para>Scanning works on three principles, these are range of detection, scanning power and the profile of the object being scanned.</para>
        <para>Only the location being moved into will be scanned.</para>

        <para>Every object, including ships, bases, celestial bodies and ground parties have a sensor profile. This can be a large negative to a large positive. If an object cannot normally be missed it will have a sensor profile greater than 100%. Note that commonly known objects and those that have been added to a player’s information database will automatically be included in appropriate scans. These objects include celestial bodies and bases.</para>
        <para>Sensor profile is largely determined by surface area. The lighter hull ships are designed to have maximum volume for cargo and therefore have large surface areas when compared to ships that are built from the same number of a heavier hull type.

        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331372"/><anchor id="_Toc62466627"/>Scan Location</title>
        <para>TUs assigned to the order are used to run multiple and partial passive scans as though moving through the location. This will be ISR Speed when in space or Orbit Time when in orbit.</para>
        <para>For example, if traversing an orbital quadrant would take a ship 24TUs assigning 240TUs to the Scan Location order equivalent to moving through the orbital quadrant 10 times.</para>
        <para>Efficiency is only used when determining TU cost to perform active scan, e.g. a ship at 50% efficiency will take twice as long to perform the scan, e.g. when assigning 50TUs, the order will take 100TUs.</para>
        <para>When in a quadrant, the ISR speed of the ship determines how many passes it can do in an area. If it does pass into sensor range of the object a scan at the position’s sensor rating is performed. If the sensors are not powerful enough to detect the object when the ship pass it then it will never be detected.</para>
        <para>Example: A ship with ISR Drives-3, Scans Location for 120 TUs in the 10th Orbital Ring.</para>
        <para>This equates to 4 Traversing Quadrant Encounter checks (=120/10x3).</para>
        <para>Each time the chance to pass close enough to scan an object is (100/Orbital Ring)%=10% which can be expressed as a probability of an encounter of 0.1 and therefore a 0.9 probability of not having an encounter. The order attempts 4 passes of the location with only a probability of 0.1 that it will be close enough to the object to have an effective scan. So roughly it has a 34% (=(1-0.94)x100%) chance of passing a target object once or more.</para>

They can be aimed at a location in a star system such as an asteroid belt, nebula or orbit of a celestial body. When used to probe a belt or nebula they will return details of the hazard data. When used to probe a celestial body they will perform a scan of the orbit (using the same mechanics of a ship entering orbit). The output of orbital probe is the equivalent to sensor output (which is used to determine the sensor power or the scan).

        <para>Related to scanning and detection is the ability to cloak. All cloaking devices are advanced technologies, but as they are not uncommon their use is described here.</para>
        <para>Cloaking devices make the ship completely undetectable irrespective of the sensor power of the scanning position. They also effectively make the cloaking position blind while cloaked, i.e. the cloaking position cannot scan.</para>
        <para>All cloaking devices can operate for a limited amount of time. After this, the position will become charged with exotic particles. These do not interfere with the normal running of the position but are easily detected, which means that the position cannot be cloaked again until the charge dissipates. This normally requires 300TUs of activity to pass since the last activation.</para>
        <para>Example: If a ship uses its cloak as its last action on a turn, the manifest will state that it is ready in 300TUs. If the ship performs 50TUs worth of actions on the next day, the manifest will state that it will be ready in 250TUs. If however only an update is requested and no actions are carried out, it will still state that it ready in 300TUs. If the ship continues to do nothing, this number will only begin to fall after the ship has accumulated 300TUs worth of available TUs. After this period the ready time will fall at 60TUs per further day of inactivity.</para>
        <para>All cloaking devices work on an optimum surface area that can be cloaked. In ships, this equates to total installation space (quantity of hulls multiplied by internal capacity). If the surface area of the ship attempting to cloak is greater than this value, the cloak will not work.</para>

        <para>Within the galaxy are millions of stars each with various celestial bodies orbiting around them. These celestial bodies may include large gas giants, terrestrial worlds or hostile rocky bodies. There could be asteroids and possibly unusual phenomena. Together these are known as a star system, or more commonly just system.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>A primary star always exists at the centre of the system. Around this, the system is broken down into 4 quadrants and 15 rings known as orbitals. This is a schematic map representing relative location and ISR paths rather than physical distance. In Phoenix, relative location is based on iso-gravitational regions. These are effectively relative travel times for ships moving from one location to another.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>Each star system is separated from other systems by phenomenal distances that almost invariably render reaching nearby stars at sub-light speeds impossible. Phenomenon called Inverse Spatial Resonance (ISR) uniquely connects one location with another through the dimensions known colloquially as subspace. Ships can use this to move from one region of space to another without travelling through the intervening real space.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>While the transition is effectively instantaneous, engaging the drive and establishing the exotic fields is not and is determined by the quality of the Jump Drive (for moving between systems) or ISR Drive (for moving around a system).</para>

        <para>System location knowledge is granted where a player has at some point gained control of a position within a restricted knowledge system. This is generally the case of the transfer of a position within the system to the player. Location knowledge allows the player to view the system on Nexus. Where the player only has location knowledge, the system will not be shown in its true location on Nexus. It will normally be shown at the bottom of the periphery map - possibly showing unconnected links to known systems.</para>
        <para>Location knowledge alone does not allow a ship to jump to the system though ships within the system can jump out to systems for which they have navigation knowledge.</para>

      <para>While most items can be carried in internal cargo space, items with specialist internal space can be installed. The game determines optimum placement of items being transport.</para>
      <para/>
      <para>There are six types of internal space:</para>
      <para/>
      <para>Ammo</para>
      <para>Damage caused by exploding ammo is initially channelled into installed magazines. </para>
      <para>Explosive damage incurred is on average half Explosive Damage Value.</para>
      <para>Example: A Torpedo (220) is hit while in a Magazine (220) and explodes for 350 damage (approximately 600/2 explosive damage). This will destroy the magazine (100 defence) and the remaining 250 damage will </para>
      <para/>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>be applied to the ship following standard cascade mechanics.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Absorbed</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>Where ammo exceeds ammo capacity, exploding ammo has a linear probability of channelling explosive damage directly into the position.</para>
      <para>Example: Following the loss of a few magazines there is twice the mass of torpedoes as capacity. It a torpedo explodes, there is a 50% chance that the explosive damage will be applied directly to the ship instead of being contained by a magazine.</para>
      <para/>
      <para>Ore</para>
      <para>As ore does not need custom fitted housing, life support or thermal regulation, containers can extend beyond the superstructure of the ship, effectively holding more than their designated install space.</para>
      <para/>
      <para>Commercial</para>
      <para>This covers both living and non-living items of Life, Drugs and Trade item types.</para>
      <para/>
      <para>Space Fighters</para>
      <para>Space fighter capacity determines the mass of space fighters and bombers launched in combat. Where excess fighters and bombers are present, a proportion of each based on relative mass will be launched and detailed in manifest. Loss of capacity will reduce quantity of active space fighters and bombers. </para>
      <para/>
      <para>Life Support</para>
      <para>Life forms cannot be carried in Cargo. Any life forms will default to life supported internal space once more appropriate internal space has been filled.</para>
      <para>Transfer of life forms paid a wage (personnel, some civilians) incurs an automatic charge equal to the standard weekly wages of the life form transferred.</para>
      <para/>
      <para>Cargo</para>
      <para>Any items, apart from life forms will default to cargo once more appropriate internal space has been filled.</para>
      <para/>
      <para>Defence</para>
      <para>Damage that would normally be applied to life forms is first applied to these items and only damage that penetrates will be applied to living items. Note that this does not actually grant internal space, e.g. Bridges grant defence for crew but do not increase life support capacity of a ship.</para>

        <para>Squadrons Using Item Type Transactions</para>
        <para>When using a squadron (without copy order option), Pick-up and Deliver Item Type will use the total mass across the squadron rather than for each individual ship. This is generally convenient as it allows different item types to be transported without having to divide up the cargo into orders for each ship, i.e. when transporting 10,000 shields and 20,000 modules the first ships in the squadron will fill up with shields and the last will take all the modules rather than allocating X shields and Y modules to each ship.</para>

        <para>When using a squadron (without copy order option), Pick-up and Deliver Item Type will use the total mass across the squadron rather than for each individual ship. This is generally convenient as it allows different item types to be transported without having to divide up the cargo into orders for each ship, i.e. when transporting 10,000 shields and 20,000 modules the first ships in the squadron will fill up with shields and the last will take all the modules rather than allocating X shields and Y modules to each ship.</para>

    <para>Bases are established as outposts but can be converted to starbases. Starbases can be converted to outposts which will deactivate aspects of the base that are not supported by outposts.</para>
    <para>Bases are established by either a ship or ground party issuing the Create Outpost order in the appropriate location. While this is generally in a sector known to contain an ore deposit, it may be in orbit or even in space. The Create Outpost order also requires a complex to be built.

Closed complexes still need to be maintained which requires 50 work hours per week - a single 'caretaker' employee.</para>
        <para>A more drastic measure is to salvage a complex. The 'salvage complex' order salvages 60% of the modules from a complex at the base. It requires 250 work hours per complex salvaged. Note that this order cannot be run if the base is currently in combat.</para>

      <para>Mercenaries can be trained into specific troop types. This requires training complexes. These complexes are both training camps and hi-tech surgeries. Each complex has a limit of 10 training programmes per week. This is set during weekly maintenance. The training program combines physical training, neural grafting of knowledge and even some augmentation surgery to impart years of training and 'false' experience within a week.</para>
      <para>Each training program, e.g. 'Human Marines', has a specific tooled blueprint. To perform a training program, the starbase requires a blueprint of the technology to be used. Each blueprint allows the starbase to train up to 10 mercenaries of the specified race to the specified troop, e.g. the blueprint Human Marine can only be used to train human mercenaries into human marines, it cannot be used to train dewiek mercenaries nor can it be used to train human mercenaries into human soldiers.</para>
      <para>The total number of troops that can be trained is limited by the quantity of blueprints, the quantity of training complexes and obviously the quantity of mercenaries of the appropriate race.</para>
      <para>Each mercenary cost 10 stellars to train, although after being trained the troop is still only paid the standard weekly wage. Each type of troop is proficient in a certain field.</para>
      <para>Soldiers</para>
      <para>The basic trained troop, these ground-pounders are ideal for planetary defence forces. They are the most proficient troops when it comes to mid-range combat manoeuvres such as urban defence and assault.</para>
      <para>Startroopers</para>
      <para>These are trained in personal shuttle suits that can reach orbit. They can therefore assault a ground-based installation without the need of personnel carriers. They can also move from one side of the planet directly to the other without the need to move over land or use personnel carriers.</para>
      <para>Crew</para>
      <para>Crew are trained in the use of vehicles, large weaponry and all manner of ordnance and electronics, including security. This makes them ideal for running space weaponry as well as remote controlling tanks and mechanised infantry such as warbots. They have never been trained in the use of personal weaponry, so are only as good as basic marines in open conflict.</para>
      <para>Marines</para>
      <para>These specialise in close quarters combat such as within the hold of a ship or on an orbital platform. They are the most proficient at short range/hand-to-hand confrontations. They are also only second to crew when it comes to control of ordnance and space weaponry.</para>
      <para>Scouts</para>
      <para>The job of the scout is to evaluate the military capabilities of other positions. This could be done on positions in the starport although it is more usual for the scouts to be placed into ground-parties to perform the mission at another location.</para>
      <para>Scouts also reduce the sensor profile of a ground party.</para>
      <para>Guards</para>
      <para>Guards are like crew but provide better crew-factors for security purposes only. This makes them ideal for taking care of slaves and other unsavoury jobs.</para>

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Yield - This is the maximum amount of the item that can be produced by a single complex during weekly maintenance. Where the individual item is greater than 1mu (such as granite slabs), the yield will represent a single unit. Yield is for the Origin sector of the resource.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Drop Step - For every multiple of the drop step the amount of MUs per complex will decrease by 10%. While the number of complexes exploiting the resource is equal to or under the drop step, each complex will produce the yield in MUs each week. If the number of complexes present is twice the drop step, half will produce the yield each, the other half will produce 90% of the yield each. Amount produced is rounded off to the nearest unit after accounting for yield and 10%.Calculations use total complexes exploiting the resource, which may be spread over multiple bases (see Dispersion below).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Stockpile/Quantity - This is the amount of resource remaining on the world. In the case of common ores, this may well be so big that it is classed as infinite. Infinite is classed as requiring more than 20 years to exhaust the stockpile using the current number of complexes. Assigning many complexes may change an infinite stockpile into a finite one.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Change – Mineral resources normally have zero change. This means that eventually the resource will become exhausted. Biological resources in a fragile ecology will also have zero change. Most biological resources however are capable of being exploited up to a threshold. This is the weekly change. This will often be slightly larger than the yield multiplied by the drop step. Exploitation above this amount will decrease the quantity present. % change increases the stockpile as % of the current stockpile. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Dispersion – Local yield is Yield at Origin sector multiplied by distance to the exploiting Base’s sector multiplied by Dispersion %, i.e. a Dispersion of 50% will halve the yield for every intervening sector between the Origin sector and the Base sector. A Dispersion of 100% allows exploitation equally from all sectors on the world.</para>

    <para>A ground party is the term for a collection of items in one location under the control of one authority. They are normally formed for a specific short-term reason and the composition invariably reflects this. A ground party set-up to survey a planet for example will consist of an exploration module and some sensors for the finding and prospecting of mineral deposits. Some shuttles or ground vehicles should be present, to allow relocation of the ground party to new sites, and finally crew are needed to operate all the items.</para>
    <para>A ground party set-up to attack a starbase on the other hand is unlikely to have much more than large amounts of ordnance and troops.</para>

    <para>Moderation is where the Game Master (human moderator) is required to access and possibly modify the game data. This centres around unique responses to player in-game activity such as exploring new worlds, interacting with their denizens and discovering new things. This is largely player driven moderation. Game driven moderation tends to revolve around new items introduced as part of mechanics updates.</para>

      <para>Explorations are simply a cursory examination of the general features associated with a type of planetary terrain on a celestial body. They contain some generic information about the world and about features common to the surface type of the world being explored.</para>
      <para>While it is unrealistic to suggest that a grasslands sector bordering equatorial deserts in the centre of a continental plate formed from eons of oceanic sedimentation before uplifting are identical to grasslands neighbouring tundra and owing their soil deposition to spreading run-off from polar glaciers, we presume that they are sufficiently similar compared to the differences with grasslands of other worlds. Further, as this information has an associated cost, charging for multiple explorations of one sector type on a single world could easily become frustratingly expensive.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331441"/><anchor id="_Toc62466695"/>Understanding an Exploration</title>
        <para>An exploration is a relatively brief piece of text in the format:</para>
        <para>Surface Exploration/Name of Celestial Body/Sector Type</para>
        <para>One or more paragraphs describing scenery and potentially interesting features.</para>
        <para>Example:</para>
        <para>Surface Exploration/Primus Adventor/Grasslands</para>
        <para>The thick lush grass grows to heights of just under three metres. The stems are under half a centimetre thick and would break under a strong wind if the grass wasn't so tightly packed.</para>
        <para>The density of the flora makes them both difficult to explore and even harder to find the various land animals that are heard.</para>
        <para>Some avian creatures are noted. These tend to be small, feeding on the seed-heads of the wind pollinated grasses.</para>
        <para>Rivers are common, winding through the vegetation and bringing the only break to the uninterrupted grass.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>The text is very open insofar as any aspect of this can be followed up by investigation. Does the lush grass seem particularly interesting? It is certainly tall for grass. Is it just grass though and has no commercial properties? It mentions seed-heads. Are there grains to be exploited? What about the animals? What sort are present, are they edible, are they dangerous? Could they be domesticated? They are heard but do numbers to warrant their exploitation?</para>
        <para>It also mentions rivers. What about these? Are they laden with silt, do they flood, is this responsible for the fertility of the grasslands? Are they deep and clear and what about the flora and fauna within them?</para>
        <para>In other words, the exploration is simply a composite of potential avenues to explore.</para>
        <para>The writing of the text is aimed at presenting the information in a straightforward manner. It is not meant to obfuscate. It the explorations reads quite bleakly there will be little the chance of discovering something a valuable resource.</para>
        <para>Example:</para>
        <para>Surface Exploration/Mu IIa/Craters</para>
        <para>The pounded surface of this ancient rubble pile asteroid is composed of little more than common silicates. Dirty white patches are noted around the newest impacts hinting that the subsurface holds ice that eventually sublimes after eons exposed to cold space. Preliminary tests only detect water and methane ice.</para>
        <para>Some sector types are less likely to yield resources than others. For example, ice on water (as in H2O) worlds are likely to only contain dust and possibly a few semi-aquatic creatures presuming life exists. Even then, life can be presumed to be sparse and any resource is still likely to be poor.</para>

        <para>This is a direct follow up to a statement in a surface exploration or a prior investigation. It can be anything from investigating the salt rich sediment along the beaches of an evaporating shallow sea to the migrating herds of hexapods discovered in the vast plains. While many will be geared towards determining if the object of the investigation can be exploited in some way by a base (using resource complexes) it can simply be satisfying curiosity, e.g. determining why a desert creature has vestigial gills.</para>

        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331445"/><anchor id="_Toc62466699"/>Customised Scan</title>
        <para>When exploring worlds, there are few commonly applied investigations that work in conjunction with Surface Exploration in maximising the amount of information available before specific investigations are made:</para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Orbital Scan - This will reveal information about appropriate aspects such as the upper atmosphere; details of a magnetosphere; minor satellites, both natural and artificial; but most importantly, any anomalies.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Low Pass Scan - Reveals a broad overview of the world that will include details on easily detectable anomalies; populations if relevant; and general surface geological features of the world. If there is an abandoned civilisation, this will normally report it and if contained on a single continent or even sector, indicate where (or simply explain the presence of ruins on the map).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Subsurface Scan - This is generally geared towards information regarding the geology of the world though may indicate the presence of a buried civilisation or localised anomaly. It may give some information regarding the formation of the world or its reveal in the case of rubble-pile asteroids, the existence of large interior voids.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331446"/><anchor id="_Toc62466700"/>New Research Avenues</title>
        <para>There are a lot of items in Phoenix that are not common knowledge. These have been added to the game as a result of game mechanic upgrades, the result of special actions or through player suggestions. In the latter two cases knowledge of the item will be given to specific individuals (added to their information archive). Players may submit special actions enquiring about new lines of research. They have to be specific and have a justification (underlying tech, in-game discovery). This is normally seeking to improve on an existing item or extend stellar cartography to the next level.</para>
        <para>Where items are being improved it is very rare that items can be improved past mkIV. mkIV normally represents the break point beyond which production costs outweigh improvement.</para>

        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331447"/><anchor id="_Toc62466701"/>Interaction with Non-Player-Characters (NPC's)</title>
        <para>NPC's covers everything from the drunk ex-Republic officers in a shady part of an urban sector on Mobile Bay to the civilian government of a large planetary population. The specifics of a special action are limitless, anything from paying the drunk to reveal where he abandoned his spaceship to putting pressure on the government to support a specific affiliation's system claim. The special action should reference any appropriate skills or information to support the action. Exploration Skill Level of the officer of the position may be accounted for (especially in diplomatic situation).</para>

      <sect3>
        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331448"/><anchor id="_Toc62466702"/>Free Action</title>
        <para>A free action is invariably at an invite from the game mechanics or in response to a previous action. They are called free actions because the standard special action fee is waivered (like adjudication requests). Common ones include a request to start a GM permitted research project, e.g. Racial Design for a specific species or claiming free cave complexes as directed by an investigation.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331449"/><anchor id="_Toc62466703"/>Query</title>
        <para>This is likely a question about the specific position. Typical things include 'why can’t I build recruitment complexes?' or ‘I have metals, why did my production fail?’</para>
        <para>Queries are rarely charged unless the wording of the query is such that it fits more comfortably into another type of special action, e.g. 'are the GTT now tapping my deposits?' or 'can the civilian population increase the amount of basic modules they are selling on the export market?'</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331450"/><anchor id="_Toc62466704"/>Data Checking</title>
        <para>Occasionally a player needs to ask the GM to look at game data and determine if the data is correct. Typical things include 'why does the newly researched blueprint in this base have zero production output?' This might be something as simple as the GM giving a resource the default item such as metals or guilders instead of the one specified in the investigation.</para>
        <para>After a game upgrade the occasional bug slips through. This can lead to results that are not consistent with the mechanics as described and require adjudication.</para>
        <para>Where an issue does not directly involve a position or lacks urgency, the GM should be contacted through Nexus.</para>

        <title><anchor id="_Toc51331451"/><anchor id="_Toc62466705"/>Everything Else</title>
        <para>Whether the special action is charged for will depend on the wording and nature of action though if it is a quick bit of advice or a question about a previous special action results, then it is rarely charged for.</para>

      <title><anchor id="_Toc51331452"/><anchor id="_Toc62466706"/>Submitting Special Actions</title>
      <para>Special actions are submitted as per the order, filling in the text box. Be concise and keep the parameters of the special action to a single objective. The GM will moderate verbose and multi-objective and otherwise rambling special actions down to a specific objective. Also bear in mind time constraints (1 special action = 1 day).</para>
      <para>Example:</para>
      <para>Send the team through for forests herding all predators and prey, cage them all then determine how best to exploit all of them.</para>
      <para>Result:</para>
      <para>Investigation/Test Word/Forest/Fauna</para>
      <para>The team set various traps and then do a little bush beating to collect specimens of the forest fauna. While avian and arboreal creatures are more adept at avoiding the traps, they manage to collect a few terrestrial creatures. The most common is a quadruped standing under a metre high. It is some form of forager judging by hits forelegs and adapted mouth parts. It is quite well camouflaged on account of its dappled hide. It can be exploited as Dappled Hog.</para>
      <para>It is then up to the player as to whether they wish to investigate the less common creatures caught or set about chasing the arboreal or avian creatures.</para>

      <title><anchor id="_Toc51331454"/><anchor id="_Toc62466708"/>Searching for Mineral Resources</title>
      <para>Production of items requires minerals. Scanning a planet for mineral deposits is known as Geological Probability Indication (GPI).

        <para>Dispersion</para>
        <para>Dispersion is the degree to which the deposit (ID#) can be exploited beyond the current sector measured between 0% (at sector only) to 100% (equally exploitable from anywhere on the world).</para>
        <para>A dispersion of 50% means that a yield of 100 for example would be 50 in an adjacent sector, 25 in the one next to that and so on.</para>

        <para>Prospecting sector {2,4} reports ID# 1234 has a yield of 25mu.</para>
        <para>The sector containing the peak yield for the deposit ID# is its source.</para>
        <para>Stockpile</para>
        <para>The total amount of ore in the deposit that can be exploited using the normal mining method. It is possible to modify this both by selecting an alternative mining method and modifying the deposit through the use of technology.</para>
        <para>Deep Core Survey</para>
        <para>This is the probability that a deep core deposit exists. These are accessed through deep core mining. Deep coring a deposit can only be conducted in the deposit source sector. This requires the exhaustive use of a Survey Rig.</para>

      <para>Example of a series of investigations</para>
      <para>The player ordered the ship to land in a forested sector and issued a surface exploration order. From this the player then investigated the trees and the creatures present. These led to further areas that the player thought might be interesting. In the table below, the bold type is the title of the special action presented by the player (they may have put a note about how they intended to perform the investigation). The response written by the referee follows:</para>

        <para>Non-Standard Special Actions</para>
        <para>Action may not fall into the basic special actions such as investigation, e.g. speaking to natives found on the planet or attempting to force natives into slavery. These special actions are dealt with in the same way as investigations. The player should write their intent. The referee will then read the special action, take into consideration parameters appropriate to the situation and give a response.</para>

        <para/>
        <para>This is an example of a player attempting to round up a few peaceful and pacifistic natives on a backward world and force them into slavery.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>Special Action</para>
        <para>Using the troops from the ship, surround one of the small camps of natives and use overwhelming firepower to force then into the ship and make them slaves.</para>
        <para>Results</para>
        <para>The 300 troops surround a small camp of around 50 natives. A quick and brutal display of firepower reduces a few protestors to charcoal and the rest of the natives to pliant captives. These are herded into the ship under close scrutiny where they are stripped, deloused and made ready for their new lives as slaves.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>The player writing the above special action may have already discovered that the natives were peaceful and without adequate weaponry so felt confident to pull-off the action with little or no problems. Had the natives been hunter-gatherers or slightly better defended, the referee may well have given a very different result.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>NB-While Phoenix does not attempt to enforce morals on players; overly extreme actions will generally be toned down or glossed over. Phrases such as ‘brutal things were done to the slaves’ will be used.</para>

        <para>Special Action Fulfilment</para>
        <para>A special action result may require the player to fulfil a requirement.</para>
        <para>Example:</para>
        <para>Having talked with some natives, they offer all their worldly wealth in precious gems for a single batch of personal communicators. A one-off special action will exchange 1mu consumer goods for 50MUs precious gems.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>Example:</para>
        <para>Cave systems extend for many kilometres through the mountains. These can be sealed from the environments and used as a basis for an outpost. The one-off exhaustive use of a special mineral extraction tech by an outpost in this sector will produce 200 cave complexes.</para>

            <para>One-off: The special action can only be performed once. Subsequent attempts at the same action under the same conditions will result in failure.

      <title><anchor id="_Toc51331485"/><anchor id="_Toc62466739"/>New Fields of Research</title>
      <para>Sometimes a new field of research will be desired. This can fall into one of two types. The first and most common is to research technology that is known to exist but the knowledge of the specific technology is restricted and unknown to the position wanting to start the project, i.e. its principle/tech/blueprint number, is not listed in the data archive. An example might be Photon Guns mkIII. They are known to exist in the game, but the blueprints not classed as common knowledge.</para>
      <para>Providing that the blueprint item number is known or can be guessed, research can be initiated (if not GM or location restricted). Guessing can prove an expensive mistake as starting an incorrect project will incur the 10,000 stellar initiation fee.</para>
      <para>While it is possible to trade for the information and have another political transfer the knowledge enabling research to begin, it is also possible to have the scientists work on existing knowledge to initiate research.</para>
      <para>Example: The owner of a starbase wishes to research Photon Guns mkIII. He has a stockpile of Photon Guns mkIII that he has traded from another faction. He also has Light Photon Guns mkIII blueprint that he captured from another faction's base. He presents these two technologies as the basis for initiating research into Photon Guns mkIII even though he does not have a copy of Photon Weaponry Tech mkIII.</para>
      <para>Successful Example: After efforts, the base has developed Photon Weapons Tech mkIII at a base along with a stockpile of Photon Cannons mkII. The owner of the base uses this as a basis for initiating research into Photon Cannons mkIII.</para>
      <para>Where research is more of a speculative venture, then there will generally be a hint from investigations that such a field is viable. Even in these circumstances all efforts should be made to ensure that tech likely to be needed in supporting the new research is present. If some but not all the necessary technology is present the Moderator might respond as to the missing technology and allow a future free action to complete once the technology is present.</para>
      <para>Failed Example: We want to start research into a new ship, the Slaver based on DTR Freighters at our IND Pirate Base. There isn't a tooled copy of the DTR Freighters at the starbase so we are prepared to research at a -7 penalty.</para>
      <para>In all cases, where technology is required to initiate research, it must be present at the base initiating research and be tooled. This is because subspace communication is closer to the pony express than the internet and invariably the supporting tech also comprises equipment needed for the research.</para>
      <para>Failed Example: We want to start research into a new ship, the Slaver based on DTR Freighters at our IND Pirate Base. There isn't a tooled copy of the DTR Freighters at the starbase but there is at IND Hidden so we are prepared to research at a -7 penalty.</para>

    <para>Starbases may assign items to sell to the world’s civilian population (Planetary Market) for stellars using the ‘Sell to Local Population’ order. The process is completed for all starbases in the game following the first daily run of the week (normally between Monday and Tuesday’s run).</para>
    <para>Three Commerce Item Types:  Trade Goods, Drugs and Life. </para>
    <para>Worlds have demands (MAX INCOME) for each Commerce types.</para>
    <para>Worlds also VALUE/MU representing mark-up of local value of items.</para>
    <para>Demand is how many stellars the population will spend on Commerce types.</para>
    <para>Demand for each Commerce type is split equally into four categories:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Low Value – items of value less than the world’s LOW VAL</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Medium Value – items between LOW VAL and HIGH VAL</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>High Value – items of value more world’s HIGH VAL</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Generic - items of any value.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Each starbase on the world has an equal share of the demand for each Commerce type.</para>
    <para>Where a starbase has insufficient items on the Planetary Market to satisfy their share of a demand category, the shortfall will be shared between other starbases on the world, e.g. if a starbase does not have any Low Value Drugs on its Planetary Market, then stellars will be used to buy Low Value Drugs from the other Starbases on the world.</para>
    <para>Each merchandising complex at the starbase allows 300 stellars of Commerce Item Types to be sold to each category, i.e. total demand for all three Commerce Types/1200.</para>
    <para>Items are sold based on relative proportion to overall quantity (not mass) of items. </para>

    </orderedlist>
    <para>The process is iterative, repeating the allocation of stellars to sales. Stellars not spent in Generic Trade are carried over to the following week (carryover cannot exceed Demand).</para>
    <para>Example: A starbase has High Value and some Low Value Drugs. The Drugs Demand is 10,000 stellars. The total value of the drugs on the Planetary Market is 8,000 High Value Drugs and 2,000 Low Value Drugs (quantity ratio 1:4). The generic category is dealt with first and completely satisfied (2,500 stellars), 500 worth of High Value Drugs, 2,000 worth of Low Value Drugs (due to quantity ratio). Nothing is sold via Low and Medium Value. The High Value category is fully satisfied (2,500 stellars). The Low Value Category was undersold by 2,500 stellars due to assignment to Generic Trade and the starbase still has 5,000 stellars worth of High Value Drugs on its Planetary Market despite only reaping half the demand.</para>

        <para/>
        <para>Example: If the player did not have a copy of EEM Warships - 75Hm, but did have the three principles; Medium Ships, Material Utilisation Metallic and Heavy Structural Design, it would be possible to either research EEM Warships - 75Hm, or if designed create a new tech with the parameters - 75Hm.</para>
        <para>The advantage to researching EEM Warships - 75Hm is that any other blueprints that are supported by the tech can then be researched. The disadvantage is that other owners of EEM Warships - 75Hm, once they find out about the Rake blueprint can research that.</para>
        <para>Many affiliations have a warship tech that is - 100HmHu (51-100 Heavy Metal hulls for HUman use). This ensures that they have a monopoly on their own warship blueprints.</para>
        <para>Example: DTR Warships - 100HmHu supports various Nebulon blueprints. Each design while incorporating different internal items and have different armour has 100 heavy metal hulls.</para>
        <para>The IMP Warships - 100HmHu supports various Ship o' the Line blueprints. Again these are built using 100 heavy metal hulls and in some cases the designs are almost identical to Nebulons. However a Nebulon blueprint will not be supported by the IMP Warship - 100HmHu tech and the appropriate research penalty will be applied should an attempt to research it be undertaken</para>

      <para>Templates, generated using the Position Editor add a huge amount of flexibility to ship design. When used in shipbuilding they allow for the shipyards to ignore the internal components specified by the ship blueprint, replacing them at the time of construction with those listed on the template.</para>
      <para>Note that when building using templates, the hulls and armour of the construction remain based on the original blueprint. If, however the template has higher mk hulls and/or armour (though has to be the same type, i.e. light and metal, heavy and crystal etc) it will use the template specifications providing that Use Best option is set to No.</para>
      <para>Example: The base is attempting to build a Warhammer design ship but wants to incorporate different weapon systems as defined by the template WARHAMMER Variant 2 WITH mkII Hulls (4321). As well as differing in internal components to the blueprint the template for the Variant 2 also differs in that it is based on mkII heavy hulls.</para>

      <para/>
      <para>If however the template had specified the use of Heavy Organic Hulls, the order would have ignored the parameter, instead attempting to use Heavy hulls.</para>
      <para>Use of Templates also has the advantage in that it adds items to the cargo (providing that they are in the base). This allows for the inclusion of ammo and personnel - everything needed to make the ship completely ready to go.</para>
      <para>Researching Ship Blueprints from Templates</para>
      <para>The Position Editor include the capability to define hull and armour items so as to allow for design ships from which to research new blueprints. Providing that the base has the underlying tech a special action to start research into a new ship design blueprint can be submitted simply quoting the template number and underlying tech.</para>

        <para>Abuse</para>
        <para>FRE are law-abiding as such there is potential for abuse with FRE. Where it comes to light that there has been an abuse, the GM will moderate and take appropriate action up to and including deleting positions.</para>
        <para>FRE and Relations</para>
        <para>FRE differs from the other Flags of Convenience in that the affiliation is considered friendly to all affiliations that are friendly to the FRE. This means that any affiliation that is friendly to the FRE can defend them. This is the only Flag of Convenience that has this capability. Amongst GM controlled factions, Halo Execution Fleet (HEF), the Yank Kastorian (KAS) and Civilian (CIV) are friendly to FRE.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>Privateer (PRV)</para>
        <para>This is low level rogue (Han Solo), operating on the fringes of legality. They can use enemy lists allowing them to hunt Darkspace and Borderlands either on behalf of their true affiliation or as mercenaries. They may however also be used as trading ships as are FRE. As they cannot operate enemy lists in Developing and Core systems, there are quite a lot of systems where they are not considered a threat though again they may be put on system enemy lists or exclusion zones to prevent them doing actions that are considered abuse by FRE.</para>
        <para>Privateers can land hostile GP’s into other faction’s bases outside Core and Developing systems but of course there is the risk that PRV are on the base’s enemy list and auto-board list. This GP can be PRV though can be any other faction (basically smuggling in a small rebel team as per the many popular sci-fi films).</para>
        <para/>
        <para>Abuse is as for FRE but applied in Core and Developing systems.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>Mercenaries (MRC)</para>
        <para>MRCs are useful for mounting operations in systems claimed by other factions without the need to raise relations hostility level. They are also good for dealing with individual ships that are hiding behind flags of convenience.</para>
        <para>Example: A GBW fleet flying the FRE FoC disperses to various systems. The faction contesting the system can of course hunt them down in Darkspace but cannot touch them in more developed space. They have the option of using raising the MRC flag of convenience on squadrons and then pursuing and attacking the FRE ships in all but Core system. They post the individual ships and add the affiliation posted list to the enemy list of the MRC ships. This allows them to fine grain control of which FRE ships they attack rather than a blanket attack on all FRE ships.</para>
        <para>While PRV ships could be used instead of MRC, MRC flagged ships gives greater scope to pursue the FRE ships into all but Core systems.</para>
        <para>MRCs can also drop hostile GP’s into all but a Core system base. Again this could be a MRC or any affiliation. This is because factions operating MRCs do so outside of their own territory and as such are likely to treat all MRCs in their territory as hostile.</para>
        <para>Abuse is as for FRE but applied in Core systems.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>Pirate (PIR)</para>
        <para>There are absolutely no restrictions on what pirates can do. They can operate anywhere, attack anywhere and ship in GP’s anywhere. On the downside as people running the PIR flag of convenience tend to do so outside their own territory, most factions have a standard policy to shoot all pirates on sight.</para>

      <para>A primary star always exists at the centre of the system. Around this, the system is broken down into 4 quadrants and 15 rings known as orbitals. The maps illustrate relative location rather than physical distance, representing relative travel times for ships moving from one location to another. Most habitable worlds are generally within orbitals 2-5 around typical G class stars.</para>
      <para>As the map represents navigation through ISR drives (micro-jumps) rather than reaction drives, the location of celestial bodies are effectively fixed (in the same way a mobile phone number remains the same irrespective of location of the phone).</para>
      <para>Stellar Class</para>
      <para>Each star has a stellar class based on the ancient Hertzsprung-Russell definition:</para>
      <para>O - blue stars (1 million solar masses)</para>
      <para>B - light blue stars</para>
      <para>A - blue/white stars</para>

      <para>While this likely has some impact on the worlds within the system such that blue stars are unlikely to be old enough to have any terrestrial worlds and deep red stars are likely too cold to have terrestrial worlds, for the most part its real value is for the production of antimatter.

        <para>A belt is simply a collection of tiny asteroids that are sufficiently numerous in a region of space to pose a navigational hazard to ships passing through the orbital quad. Entering an orbital quad containing a belt has a probability of striking an asteroid and suffering damage. Ships automatically attempt to avoid collisions.

        <para>Navigational Buoys</para>
        <para>Buoys represent a series of beacons that have been trail blazed through an asteroid belt and linked to two fixed locations on either side of the belt. They are created through special actions (one special action on either side of the belt) by exhausting a platform and 10 sensors each time. The second special action should also request that the second buoy is linked to the first.</para>
        <para>Map Safe Route</para>
        <para>Mapping a safe route through an orbital quad containing a belt requires the exhaustive use of Belt Analysis as a special action by a base within the system (tooled Stellar Cartography is also required but not exhausted). This will generate a navigation code that is used along with the Enter Belt order (anyone knowing the code can use it). The route will also have a minimum officer dodge skill required to use the route (normally) based on the % chance of a collision for the belt:</para>

The decision as to which items to integrate lies with the player. In the above report the player chooses to use Structural Modules to satisfy the Structural infrastructure requirement as the Rock Structural Modules are intended to build cave complexes for the base. </para>

        <para>Political order ‘List Governments’ reports available government choices. The details include modifications the government will make to infrastructure statistics of the world at Colonisation Stages and criteria for establishment.</para>
        <para>Establishing a government requires the presence of an active political position at the capital base issuing the order. Where a government is restricted to an affiliation, the political must be in the affiliation though the capital base does not need to be.</para>
        <para>Example: A GTT capital base may issue the Establish Government {Imperial Territories} {33334} where Imperial Territories is a government restricted to the IMP and {33334} is the item number of IMP Political currently within the GTT capital base.</para>
        <para>The Audit World order can test the effect of a government on infrastructure. If the order is issued with a government filled in, the report will be generated in Testing mode.</para>
        <para>Example: A world has recently integrated people and Infrastructure Development, achieving Colonisation Stage 3. Currently the world has an Ad Hoc government. Audit World {} {Capitalist} {} is issued to determine the potential changes to infrastructure.</para>

          <para>Specialist civilians appear on world export markets. The frequency is based on the Infrastructure Stage of the world and the type reflect the current government and Infrastructure Upgrades on the world. They can also be obtained through the ‘Use Political Influence’ order.</para>
          <para>If no readily available source of specialist civilian can be found, special actions issued at the most reasonable location will indicate the best course of action to find one (which may simply offer one for a stellar fee).</para>
          <para>Specialist civilians normally have high wages which ends when they are integrated into a population. Civilians cannot be picked up or otherwise removed from a world once integrated. </para>

Seconded troops’ control factors count towards satisfying the Control requirement for establishing a government.</para>
          <para>Seconding costs 30 stellars per troop.</para>
          <para>Control requirement is increased by the Resistance to Change of the existing government.</para>
          <para>Example: Anarchy has a 15,000 Resistance to Change. Establishing a Port government (1,000 Control) therefore requires 16,000 Control factors to be contributed from integrated troops.</para>

      <para>Example: For a native population with Iron Age level infrastructure and a willingness to embrace contemporary levels of technology and similarities to Felini, a weekly raw uplift of 0.02% is typical, i.e. around 6,000 natives uplifted to felini on a world with 30 million. Around 1,500 natives are also uplifted to naplians</para>
      <para>Example: A more advanced culture such as Earth circa 2020 might have a much higher uplift %, possibly as high 0.1%.</para>
      <para>Example: A large native population consists of multiple species one of which is like wimbles. A player could direct uplifiting to favour the wimble natives (wimbles as the destination sentient species) or elect for even uplifting (sentient as the destination species) or even opt for naplians.</para>

        <para>A planetary atmosphere is essentially columns of gas above each sector. Factors such as relative molecular weight, gravity, planetary curvature, chemistry, magnetospheres, and temperature are ignored. </para>
        <para>Mechanics are based on using 1,000mu of a given terraforming item per sector as the optimum amount. This very crude model keeps the mechanics relatively simple.</para>
        <para>Each column of gas is considered to have an Atmospheric Volume (AV) equal to 1,000 x Optical Depth.</para>
        <para>Each gas component therefore contributes AV per sector proportional to its atmospheric %.</para>
        <para/>
        <para>Example: Each sector will have 20,000AV on a world with 20 optical depth. A near terrestrial world (78% N2/20% O2/2% halides) will therefore have 15,600AV of N2, 4,000AV of O2 and 400AV halides per sector.</para>
        <para>The area of the world is used when making atmospheric terraforming calculations.</para>
        <para>Example: The above world is a moon, 16x12. It has 3,072,000AV of N2, 768,000AV of O2 and 76,800AV of halides.</para>
        <para>Atmospheric terraforming modifies the amount of AV for a specific atmospheric component, recalculates the relative abundance of each component and determining the new optical depth. The process is isothermal, i.e. no change in planetary temperature. Temperature terraforming is adiabatic, i.e. there is no change in optical depth.</para>

        <para>The terrain type of a sector can be changed by integrating the infrastructure items and plants into the sector. The amount and type of infrastructure items depends on the target terrain type and world terraforming index. Where the target sector type requires water, this is criteria is achieved from adjacent sectors and background water levels of the world.</para>

        <para>Grasslands largely require items that provide Agricultural Infrastructure points. The lack of a plants requirement is due to the sector already having sufficient plants suitable for repurposing.</para>

        <title><anchor id="_Toc62466805"/>Flee Checks</title>
        <para>Following the detection of an enemy, a flee check is conducted if required. Combat will not occur if the flee attempt is successful. If combat does not occur the active position resumes processing its orders.</para>
        <para>A position will attempt to flee combat if it has elected to do so, or if it is incapable of combat. The fleeing position must have a positive combat speed and its combat speed (not flee speed – flee speed is only tested during combat) must be greater than the combat speed of the fastest hostile position (after accounting for enemy tractor factors). If the speed test fails, cargo will be dumped if the option has been set to make (see Dump Cargo below).</para>
        <para>Where multiple positions are attempting to prevent a ship from fleeing, the flee check is conducted against all positions and if multiple attacking positions can prevent the ship from fleeing, the slowest is selected to prevent it fleeing and targets it (and will not be involved in further flee checks). This mechanic leaves faster positions free to attempt to prevent other positions from fleeing.</para>
        <para>Flee Speed is the speed of a fleeing ship once combat starts. This is calculated from double the thrust output for the fleeing position. A position with flee option set may be stopped for combat but have sufficient fleet speed to escape combat at the end of round 1.</para>
        <para>Example: A fast ship is stopped for combat by a platform with just sufficient tractor beams to reduce its combat speed to zero. The platform fires on the manoeuvring ship during round zero (ships cannot flee on round zero) and round one. The ship survives these and as it has double its thrust output during combat due to fleeing, it still has a positive flee speed and is able to leave combat at the end of the round.</para>
        <sect4>
          <title>Combat Speed</title>
          <para>ISR drives do not function in combat (though do deliver some pre-combat damage due to colliding fields). Combat speed of the ship is determined by reaction drives; thrust engines and combat engines (but not landing engines).</para>
        </sect4>
        <sect4>
          <title>Tractor Beams</title>
          <para>The total output of reaction drives, combat engines and rocket boosters of the fleeing ship is reduced by the modified tractor beam output of opposing positions before determining flee speed. The modifier is the of the Integrity Mod for the opposed position. Platforms and bases capable of using naval weapons have and effective Integrity Mod of 0.5. As flee checks are calculated between individual positions, only the tractor beams of the individual positions are considered i.e. not the total tractor beams from multiple positions.</para>
          <para>Example: A Light Hull ship has an Integrity Mod of 2, while a Heavy Hull is 0.5. Tractor beams fired at the Light Hull have double output, while those fired at the Heavy Hull have half output.</para>
        </sect4>
        <sect4>
          <title>Dump Cargo</title>
          <para>The chance of escaping combat using a chaff cloud is based on the relative mass being ejected to the surface area of the ship. A factor of 20 is sufficient to guarantee success and less mass gives proportional probability of escaping. Living items, Guilders and Antimatter Fuel are not dumped when executing this action.</para>
          <para>Example: A barge has a surface area of 90, therefore ejecting 1,800MUs of cargo is sufficient for them to escape. If insufficient mass is available, the chance of escaping using the chaff cloud is based linearly on the ratio of amount of chaff to amount needed. In the case of the barge for example, having 450MUs of cargo to dump gives the ship a 25% chance of escaping.</para>

        <para>A position will fire on targets up to its Maximum Targets setting. If the resulting target list has more entries, preference will be sorted as per combat options selection. These include options to engage certain hull sizes and types, position types (bases, ships etc). Weighting to individual positions is adjusted based on quantity of positions present. </para>
        <para>Example: A pirate has an entire affiliation on its enemy list and encounters an enemy squad of 30 capital ships and 2 freighters. As it has the combat option to referentially target freighters and a Maximum Targets setting of 3, it will fire on the two freighters and one of the capital ships.</para>

        <para>Boarding occurs during turn processing as opposed to standard combat at the end of the run. There are two types of boarding action, for control of the target position (ship or platform), or simply to try to grab the cargo. The latter is termed Raiding:</para>

          <title>Damage</title>
          <para>Each successful hit delivers the weapon or ammo damage as specified on the tech manual. This is modified and the resulting (penetrating) damage is applied to the structure and items of the target.</para>

          <para>Each Attenuation Layer that applies reduces weapon damage by approximately half of the Attenuation Layer depth x Armour Factor of the weapon.</para>
          <para>Example: Beam weapons with a damage of 100 are fired at a target on the surface of a world with an optical depth of 20. After passing through the atmosphere the weapons will have an average damage of 90 (=between 80 and 100). If the beam weapons had an armour factor of 0.5, the optical depth would be 10 (=20 x 0.5) and the average damage would be 95 (=between 90 and 100).</para>
          <para>Individual weapon damage is subjected to attenuation. Low damaging weapons rarely penetrate highly attenuating layers even though the total damage from a large barrage is high.</para>
          <para>Layers are dealt with sequentially: Atmosphere, Deflector Arrays*, Scintillator, Shields, Armour. Some weapon types ignore specific layers.</para>
          <para>*Deflector Arrays are used to modify how damage interacts with the following layers (see Deflector Arrays).</para>
          <para>Damage Penetrating Layer = Pre-layer Damage – fn(Layer Thickness Value x Armour Factor)</para>

          <title>Damage Assignment to Items</title>
          <para>Damage is applied to a single item. Item damage is selected by total area of the item compared to the overall area of the entire position.</para>
          <para>Example: A ground party consists of 1000mu 50 shuttles (=1,000 area – same as mass) and 100 crew (=100 area). There is 90% chance that the first damage will be applied to a shuttle. </para>
          <para>Damage Reduction</para>
          <para>Before damage is applied, it is first reduced by up to the Damage Reduction for the item. Damage reduction represents items abilities to ignore small amounts of damage.</para>
          <para>Example: A Veteran Soldier has a Damage Reduction of 2. Damage assigned is first reduced by on average 1 point. If the incoming damage was only 1 point, it would mean that the damage is cancelled with no further affect.</para>
          <para>If the damage applied to the item (after damage reduction) is lower than the defence of the item:</para>

          <para>Example: A platform with 4 charged Deflector Arrays (+200 shield depth) has a total Shield Depth of 320, further increased to 350 by Scintillators. A weapon delivers 400 damage of which 250 (in this instance) is absorbed by the outer Deflector Array, reducing deflector factors. The outer Deflector Array’s Factors are reduced by 250 (damage absorbed). 100 is then attenuated further by 80 (in this instance) from the armour layer. 20 damage is then randomly assigned to an item within the platform.</para>
          <para>Example: A platform of 8,000 hulls has a Shield Recharge of 10,000. Discharging a Deflector Array requires it to absorb more than 90,000 (=8,000 x 10 + 10,000) damage in a single round. Even if 200,000 damage is delivered, only the outermost Deflector Array will be discharged at the end of the round and shields and armour will only begin taking damage in the round following the discharging of the last Deflector Array.</para>
          <para/>
          <para>Example: Heavy Photon Batteries penetrate the Deflector Array enhanced Shield Depth with sufficient damage to also penetrate the armour layer. While the Armour cannot be damaged through damage absorption there is still a chance that penetrating damage will hit an armour item based on random damage allocation.</para>

        <para>Short-range combat occurs when one position attempts to take control of another position (boarding or ground assault). </para>
        <para>Capturing a base requires at least one assaulting position to enter the starport to usurp Control. </para>
        <para>Positions attempting to gain control of the target are flagged as attackers.</para>
        <para>The target of the Control contest and positions aiding it are flagged as defenders.</para>
        <para>While Control is being contested, combat continues, and damage is sustained.</para>
        <para>The defenders start short range combat with 100% control of the target.</para>
        <para>Control changes following each round of combat is determined by comparing Control Factors for the positions involved in Short Range Combat, i.e. forces contributing to damage from longer ranges do not contribute their control factors.</para>
        <para>As Control Factors are contributed by ordnance and troops, destroying, and killing them reduces a position’s Control Factors.</para>
        <para>Control Factors provided by ordnance (vehicles) cannot exceed Control Factors provided by troops.</para>
        <para>Troops provide the highest Control Factors to mass, i.e. they are better at capturing rather than destroying targets.</para>
        <para>The relative amount of cover within the short-range battle is its Spread. This is the spread of the Control Target.</para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Packed – lots of cover but ordnance and troops are jammed in tight.</para>

            <para>Disperse – lots of open spaces but damage splash is normally lost.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>Troops (and some ordnance) have preferred (optimum) spreads. Their control factor contribution is halved for each threat step from optimum. Note that their damage output is unaffected (though damage will be affected by factors such as spread, blast radius and ground splash as per the mechanics in Naval – Weapon Statistics).</para>
        <para>Example: A soldier will contribute 4 Control Factors when in a Normal Spread, 2 in Close and Open Spreads and 1 in Packed and Disperse Spreads. The soldier will always have a damage of 8.</para>
        <para>
          <inlinegraphic fileref="embedded:Picture 55" width="6.3965inch" depth="2.302inch"/>
        </para>
        <para>Example: In the above manifest, the current spread is Packed. While total factors are 16,000, soldiers and light tanks only contribute 3,000(=12,000 x 0.5 x 0.5) factors at packed spread resulting in 7,000 current factors. If the base changes its spread to normal (by building or destroying complexes or using modules with the Set Spread Type order), it will increase to 13,000 factors.</para>
        <para>Control contests are slightly weighted in favour of the defender due to a random factor. This is only significant if the two forces are evenly matched.</para>

An attacker (consisting of 1,000MUs of troops military items) can only gain 5% (=1000/20000) control of the base per round.</para>
          <para>Example: A mining base consisting of a few troops has 1 command, 3 security and 80 mines. Following the death of the troops in the opening round, the base has a resistance of 18,000(=4,000 + 3 x 2,000 + 80 x 0.1 x 1,000). 4,000 troops will gain approximately 22% (=100 x 4,000 / 18,000) per round, i.e. probably capture it in a day. </para>
          <para>Maximum gain of control where there is a defending force is limited to 10% per round when a base is the control target; 25% for GPs and boarding.

          <para>Control factors from vehicles is capped at the control factors of the troops (as per the current spread of the base). </para>
          <para>Soldiers do the most damage</para>
          <para>While they have only half the control factors of marines and startroopers they deliver the most damage. They will deliver this damage irrespective of spread though generate most control factors at Normal Spread.</para>
          <para>Marines have high control but deliver little damage</para>
          <para>Marines have double the control factors of soldiers and a packed spread means the defenders only take 2% damage. They are good when combined with high damaging ordnance.</para>
          <para>Startroopers </para>
          <para>When combined with a open spread they have excellent control compared to an attacking force consisting of mercenaries. The main drawback is the amount of hits against an open spread by an attacking force. The work best where there is sufficient numbers of weather the increased hits against the defending force.</para>
          <para>Trained troops have Damage Reduction</para>
          <para>Damage reduction is good when it comes to dealing with militia and mercenaries which normally deliver little damage. </para>
          <para>Militia</para>
          <para>Unpaid troops, especially in large amounts act to soak hits (due to damage carryover being lost instead of being applied to another item).</para>
          <para>Do not rely on Vehicles</para>
          <para>While the base may feel impregnable with tens of thousands of tanks, do not rely on them. A determined attacking force of troops can wrestle control of the base. They will capture some of these vehicles, not only ousting the defending troops but then also employing them to superior effect (unless the base changes tactics to Retreat before the enemy takes control).</para>
          <para>Warbots</para>
          <para>Their negative control factors are deducted from total control factors. They are useful for delivering damage to an attacking force but only sensible when they will not compromise the total control factors. They are also only used in offense and therefore their negative factors do not compromise a base (but also don’t deliver damage in defense).</para>
          <para>Anti-personnel Devices</para>
          <para>APDs are only active while the retain at least 80% control. They can be devastating due to the control modifier to %chance of hitting defender. They are worth building providing the attackers will not find it easy to gain maximum control per round.</para>

          <para>Items with defence capacity divert damage that would hit life items into the bunker and also benefit from Damage Reduction.</para>

        <title><anchor id="_Toc62466826"/>Boarding</title>
        <para>Boarding is used to capture Ships and Platforms. A position can perform multiple boarding attempts and a position can have multiple boarding attempts made against it. Boarding is done as an order (active) and during the run (not during combat) or by a base in response to an enemy ship landing in its starport (passive).</para>
        <sect4>
          <title>Active Boarding</title>
          <para>This is initiated by using the 'Board Position' Order or in response to detecting a position on the Auto Board list. The target position must be detected, and the boarder faster than the target or target is stationary before it can be boarded. Tractor beams are used as in standard enemy checks to reduce opponent’s speed. The check differs from standard flee checks as the target’s flee speed rather than combat speed is used. Boarding therefore normally requires a fast ship with sensors and at least one tractor beam. The boarding ship is subjected to space weapons fire from the target and all defending positions before progressing to boarding. This does not count as standard Space Combat and does not trigger an Enemy list check in the location.</para>
          <para>While enemy lists are not checked as part of initiating a boarding action, they are checked when entering a new location. Consequently, a position may be stopped for battle before running a ‘Board Position’ order or activating its auto board list.</para>
          <para>If positions are present at the location with standing orders (lists) to defend the position about to be boarded, they will also open fire during the approach for a single round.</para>
          <para>Example: A pirate cloaks into an orbit with a platform with all pirates on its enemy list. It initiates a boarding action against a freighter belonging to a neutral third affiliation. As the platform is neither defending, nor supporting the freighter, the boarding action will proceed as no enemy lists are checked and the platform didn’t detect the pirate.</para>
          <para>Example: A freighter is in a squadron with defending escorts. A pirate attempting to board the freighter is fired on by the ship about to be boarded and the defending escorts. The freighter fires for four rounds (presuming it has weapons) and hits deliver double weapon damage. The escorts fire for one round with no accuracy or damage modifier.</para>
          <para>Active boarding composes 4 steps (all undertaken as part of the Board Position order):</para>
          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Detection – the location is scanned for the target. Failure to detect the position ends the boarding attempt. More attempts can be attempted.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>Chase – the target attempts to flee (and may use dump cargo if the option has been set). Target’s flee speed needs to be beaten (tractor beams are also used). Stationary targets are automatically caught.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>Approach (landed and docked targets ignore this step) – during which the boarding position is subjected to 4 rounds of naval weaponry fire from the defender. All attacks hit (+20 ACC) and weapon damage is doubled. Defending positions also subject the boarder to 1 round of fire (no damage or accuracy modifier).</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>Control Contest – if the boarder has not been destroyed, a control battle is conducted for the target (see short-range combat).</para>

          </orderedlist>
        </sect4>
        <sect4>
          <title>Boarding Parties</title>
          <para>The forces sent to attempt boarding are set in advance using the ‘Set Boarding Party’ standing order detailed. Once set they are detailed in the boarding party report section of the manifest. Boarding attempts without setting a boarding party will fail. All bases should set a boarding party to initiate passive boarding of undesirable ships landing in the starport. The order allows the setting of items that are not currently on the position or in amounts larger than are currently present for greater flexibility.</para>
          <para>Example: A pirate ship includes veteran marines in the boarding party despite having none to ensure that any promoted marines will not be left behind in subsequent boarding actions.</para>
          <para>The allocated boarding party is only used in when the position is attempting to board another position. In defence all items capable of being involved in boarding actions are counted. While everything in the position can be added to the boarding party, this runs the risk of everything being killed, leaving the boarding position vulnerable.</para>
          <para>Example: A pirate ship has a mixed crew of humans and naplians. The boarding party is set to only include naplians. If over the course of multiple disastrous boarding actions all the naplians are killed, the pirate still has humans to run and defend the ship.</para>
          <para>Example: A ship has a mixture of marines, soldiers and crew. The boarding party is set to only include marines for the same reason as the above example.</para>
          <para>Only items suitable for boarding actions may be added to the boarding party. Attempts to add unsuitable items to a boarding party using the ‘Set Boarding Party’ order will fail.</para>
          <para>Example: A boarding party report is shown below detailing troops available to fill the boarding party roster and the maximum (MAX) units that will be sent if available. </para>

          <para>Example: After the first round of combat, the boarder has gained 8% control. The boarder hits with 2% of their weapons, i.e. 2 out of every 100 troops hits an enemy. The defender hits with 58% (= [90-75]2/62.5%) of their attacks. Boarding actions should therefore aim to achieve at least 20% control in the first round, reducing incoming attacks to the minimum 16%.</para>
          <para>Example: The first boarding attempt failed and a second one is attempted with 10% control gained on the first round. The defender hits with 59% (=1 + [90-75]2/62.5%) with a minimum of 17% hits once they have lost at least 20% control. </para>
          <para>Example: After the tenth boarding attempt by multiple positions against the target (such as a large platform), defenders will hit with at least 26% of their attacks while the boarder will still only be hitting with 2%.</para>
          <para>Example: A 100 heavy hull ship has a surface area of 100. It can be boarded by parties up to 1,000 units (troops, warbots etc). A boarding party consisting of 1,500 marines and 500 soldiers (twice maximum boarder size) is reduced to 750 marines and 250 soldiers.</para>

          <para>Reboard – in case the target failed to be captured during the first attempt, multiple attempts will be conducted provided the boarder still has TU’s and sufficient troops. Sufficient troops is the % of troops available from the inventory against the overall size of the boarding party, e.g. if the designated party comprises 200 troops, a 50% reboard means that reboarding will only be attempted if the formed boarding party has least 100 troops. Setting reboard to 100% will cause attempts to reboard to fail if the entire boarding designated boarding party cannot be fulfilled. Setting reboard to 0% will mean that reboarding will continue providing a troop is available to send.As the % is the overall boarding party size, it allows some part of the party roster to go unfulfilled providing the % is satisfied.</para>
          <para>Example: A boarding party is set to 100 marines and 100 soldiers with a reboard of 50%. Providing that the sum of marines and soldiers comes to at least 100, reboarding will be attempted. If however the party consisted of 150 marines and 50 soldiers and there were only 20 marines but 100 soldiers, the reboard would fail as the boarding party would be 70(=20+50) would be sent, less than 50% of the designated boarding party.</para>

          <title>Passive Boarding</title>
          <para>A position landing at a hostile base is automatically boarded by the base if it has set the option to board and has a ground party.</para>
          <para>Base Auto Boarding</para>
          <para>When a Ship lands in a hostile base it can either be automatically boarded or blasted with the full ground force of the base (or both) depending on how the base governor sets his options. The options for boarding are set through the 'Boarding Options' order and are displayed on the 'Boarding Party Report' for a base. The default for a base is to attempt to board a Ship that lands and then blow it up if the boarding fails. A large base should have enough tanks etc. to destroy a landed Ship and the Ship will not be able to respond with space weapons due to the close range.</para>
          <para/>
          <para>Note: Until a boarding party is set all bases will effectively skip boarding attempts and the ship will then be blasted in ground combat (this is to prevent landing ships with lots of troops as a means of killing troops). Also boarding parties should be large (1000 marines will most likely capture a Ship with 100 marines) but making them too large will open the base to massive losses. For instance Ships landing with a 1000 soldiers will be very difficult to board and it may be better to lose a small force and then leave it rather than boarding with a large number which are all destroyed.</para>

          <para>In both boarding and standard short range combat the number of troops promoted from the surviving troops is 10%- 30% of the casualties. Veterans are essentially bought with the blood of normal troops, this makes their effective cost ~ 50 stellars (as you have to lose 5 troops at 10 stellars each to obtain one). Their advantage is that they are roughly twice as effective as a basic troop of the same type and so after a year they pay for themselves.</para>

          <para>Defending against Boarding</para>
          <para>When deciding on weaponry to mount on a ship that is likely to be subjected to boarding, the first consideration is that the ship will be delivering double damage for four rounds against the would-be boarder. This makes lighter weapons (higher damage to mass ratio) a serious consideration even when the boarding ship is heavy hulled. HESH(293) rounds are reasonable and there are quite a few more effective restricted knowledge ammo's to research or trade for.</para>
          <para/>
          <para>As well as the opening volleys against the boarding ship, the one other tactic in defending against boarding is to ensure that there are troops on the ship. A ship is a packed environment and as such Veteran Marines are best at maintaining control of the ship. These have both the best control factors at packed spread but also benefit from damage reduction. As the attackers invariably inflict low damages (as boarding is limited to 1mu items such as troops), DR is highly effective. Soldiers are good at inflicting damage against the boarding party though the trade-off is in control factors. It effectively comes down to how much the ship is worth compared to the wages required to defend it and the probability of being boarded.</para>
          <para/>
          <para>A skirmish ship for example, designed to enter enemy territory and drop missiles on enemy outposts is likely suffer multiple boarding attempts on the next day before it can cloak out of orbit and escape battle because boarding attempts are initiated during the run and therefore can be attempted before the ship moves away. As such these ships are best manned by a lot of troops. Using (if available) veteran marines will give the best control factors and thereby require the boarder to field a large force or potentially not gain any control (and therefore deliver no damage) while still being subject to damage. Soldiers however are still effective at dealing damage though against a large boarding force of marines may still fall relatively quickly.<anchor id="_Toc51331534"/></para>

        <title><anchor id="_Toc62466827"/>Scouting</title>
        <para>Scouting is used by a ground party to gauge the military defences of a target. From this, cost to capture may be evaluated. This is used in conjunction with a detailed scan and tactical location to determine whether an assault should be the made. </para>
        <para/>
        <para>In simple terms, providing the attacker has equal military mass to defending military mass it has the potential of gaining 10% control per round (as it is normally the lower of complexes and troops and there seems no point sending an inferior attacking force). The actual control gained (proportion of the 10%) comes down to attacking control factors to defending control factors. As hits against the attacker significantly increase while the defender has at least 90% control, gaining the first 10% is paramount. Gaining 20% control is also good if cost effective. </para>
        <para>Achieving 10% by the end of the first day requires 2.5% per round and the latter 5% per round. Looking at the odds table attaining for control factor ratio modifier, attaining 2.5% (=25%x10%)/round requires 3:1 ratio, while attaining 5%(=50%x10%)/round requires 6:1 ratio.</para>
        <para>Somewhere in the middle with 4:1 ratio ensures that the first 10% control is gained within the first day after accounting for losses presuming normal assault tactic. Tactics such as Assault and Storm may result in heavy casualties when attacking open and disperse spreads unless high odds (attacker to defender control factors) are achieved.</para>

        <para>Example: Scout party consisted of 50 scouts of a small starbase consisting of a few hundred complexes.</para>

        <para>A detailed scan is also conducted.</para>
        <para>
          <inlinegraphic fileref="embedded:Picture 60" width="4.761inch" depth="4.0634inch"/>
        </para>
        <para/>
        <para>4:1 control factor ratio requires 120,000 control factors (= 4 x 27183).</para>
        <para>From the scout report the defenders have:</para>
        <para>15,000 Light vehicles and turrets tend to be 20MU each = 300,000MU</para>
        <para>Troops = 5,500MUs</para>
        <para>Even though resistance from complexes is lower (285,000), the military stills needs to be overcome so using this as the benchmark is necessary.</para>
        <para>The attacker should therefore have military mass of at least 300,000mu.</para>
        <para>If half the attacking control factors is from ordnance, this means 60,000 control from troops.</para>
        <para>This is packed so 60,000 control factors = 8,000 marines (for best factors)</para>
        <para>292,000mu in ordnance = 14,600 light tanks.</para>
        <para>60,000 control factors in ordnance = 15,000 light tanks (so approximately the same).</para>
        <para>This does not account for losses and it can be expected that 4,000 hits initially will kill a few hundred troops (due to relative tank to troop mass) and possibly as many as 2,000 tanks (20% of 15,000 vehicle hits, each with a 50% chance of taking out a tank).</para>
        <para>Taking 20,000 tanks and 20,000 troops (say 5,000 soldiers or mercs) is therefore not unreasonable.</para>
        <para>The cost of training and moving these troops is arguably 400,000 stellars and the tanks cost 500,000 so give or take a million stellars (if the assault is a disaster and everything is lost).</para>
        <para>How much is the base worth?</para>
        <para>300 complexes (from the detailed scan) each worth around 1,000 stellars each and around 100,000 in other items (after removing military). A basic estimate and not accounting for tech and valuable merchandise is therefore 600,000 stellars.</para>
